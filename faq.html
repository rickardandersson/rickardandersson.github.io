	<h1>FAQ</h1>

	<h2>Do you pay miners for transaction fees included in blocks?</h2>
	<p>Yes</p>

	<h2>Do you charge miners a transaction fee when they are paid?</h2>
	<p>No</p>

	<h2>Which currency are you currently mining?</h2>
	<p>I can't make that information public, because it would increase the network hashrate of that currency, increasing the difficulty and orphans, lowering our profits. But rest assured that my profitability calculator is advanced, accurate, and up to date.</p>

	<h2>What currencies do you mine?</h2>
	<p>I can't make that information public either. But I consistently check the profitability of coins that are put on exchanges. So the basic answer is "the most profitable ones".</p>

	<h2>When do I get paid?</h2>
	<p>Payouts happen once a day at 2:30 AM UTC. If your balance is above 0.01 BTC, then you will get paid.</p>

	<h2>What is the unexchanged balance?</h2>
	<p>This is your balance of coins other than bitcoins. My auto-exchanger will convert them into bitcoins, usually within a day. Some coins take a while to reach "trade maturity" to where you can send them without paying a fee. These coins will take longer to be converted into bitcoins.</p>

	<h2>What is the immature unexchanged balance?</h2>
	<p>This is your balance obtained from blocks that have not yet reached maturity, and are therefore possible orphans. After a designated number of blocks, you will be credited these coins, and they will go under your "unexchanged balance" column. Some coins take longer than others to mature. For example, NovaCoin takes three days.</p>

	<h2>How many exchanges do you use?</h2>
	<p>I have four exchanges automated, and I occasionally manually trade at a fifth.</p>

	<h2>Do you use a variable difficulty?</h2>
	<p>No. The difficulty is static at 512. This reduces my server load.</p>

	<h2>Does having a difficulty as high as 512 reduce my profits?</h2>
	<p>No. The only downside is that it increases your very short-term variance since you'll only find a share every minute or so on a 1 MH/s rig. There is misinformation on the bitcoin forum stating that a high difficulty reduces your profit if you have a slow GPU. This is untrue. It has no influence on your profit.</p>
